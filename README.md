# CLUBI
Overview:
After clearing JEE when we got into IITR then we came to know about various clubs ranging from cultural to editorial to Tech clubs but approximately there were more than 50 clubs and societies in IITR so as a Fresher it was very difficult for us to keep a track of what work is done by different clubs, what are their fields of interest. Hence came the idea to build a  app where the IITR junta will get collectively all relevant info about clubs, their work, relevant links of club’s website to FB-Insta pages, blogs, contacts etc. 
Features:
•	Sorting of all clubs and societies in Tech, Cultural, Editorial, Others categories.
•	Then in each section list of all clubs. Ex: Upon clicking Cultural clubs, user will get full list of all Cultural Clubs.
•	Then upon clicking any of the club user will get all information about that clubs ranging from About, FB-Insta Links, Website, Contacts etc. Ex. Upon clicking Fine Arts under cultural club section user will get all info about it.
•	This will help the students to have more organized data about all clubs.

Future Plans:
As our team consists of all FRESHMAN so due to shortage of some implementation knowledge of some features and also due to time constraints of Syntax Error there were some features that we thought to include but we were not able to do so. We wish that we keep working on this project and implement them in future. Here are some of them:
•	In built event planner for all clubs, where clubs can post links of workshop, intro talk etc. and students can set reaminder of relevant evets.
•	Clubs can upload the recordings, resources and any other details related to them for the students to access.
•	Students can bookmark events.
•	Students can select favourites club so that they get notifications about those clubs
